# Text-generation-and-summarization-using-nlp
I developed an innovative model leveraging LangChain and the Cohere language model (LLM) for advanced text generation and summarization. It handles user inputs, extracts text from handwritten images, and summarizes PDFs efficiently. With a robust codebase, my model is a versatile tool for enhancing productivity and information accessibility.
